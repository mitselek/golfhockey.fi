	   <h2>SANTA CLAUS SAFARI, FINNISH LAPLAND<br/>1-DAY TOUR</h2>
		<p>We welcome you to come and experience the most important elements of the magical ambience of Lapland!</p>
		<p>Your adventure begins with a refreshing cruise on a traditional riverboat along the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki rivers. A visit to the home of Lappish family and their workshop is the first stop on our cruise. After this, the riverboat will take you to a local reindeer farm, where you can learn about Lappish culture and reindeer rearing. Enjoy a delicious Lappish lunch and participate in a ceremonial crossing of the Arctic Circle during your visit to the farm. In the afternoon, the tour continues by car to the Santa Claus Village for a meeting with Mr. Claus himself, after which you have a chance to do some shopping before returning to the city.</p>
