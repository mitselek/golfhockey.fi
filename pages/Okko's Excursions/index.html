Helsinki is a ideal gateway for a city-hopper to one of the near-by European cities. Otto's Excursions has been arranging such trips for foreigners, visiting Helsinki, since 1997. All these tours can be made with a very short notice. Even Russia may be visited with a help of a express-visa for which only a full day is required.
